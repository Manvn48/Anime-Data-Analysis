# Anime Data Analysis and recommendation Project

Here we have two Datasets anime.csv and rating.csv that are obtained from Kaggle. They're Basically database of myanimelist.com  where you can create a user account then there we have some personalized features like rating, discussion forums, reviews system etc.

So my main focus was analysis but I end up doing this little recommendation system thing.

I used Tf-idf vectorization technique here because my coursework contains information retrievel and so i thought of doing a application of what i studied. For similarity i used Cosine Similarity.
