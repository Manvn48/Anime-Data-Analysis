Title: Enhancing Anime Exploration through Genre-based Recommendations

Our project focuses on developing a personalized anime recommendation system that assists users in discovering new anime based on their preferences. Instead of relying solely on conventional methods, we harness the richness of anime genres as a pivotal factor in our recommendation process. Genres serve as a fundamental element in characterizing an anime's themes, moods, and overall style. By analyzing the genre information of various anime series, we can identify patterns and connections that allow us to suggest relevant anime choices.
