# Anime Data Analysis and recommendation Project

## Project Overview

Anime has become a popular form of entertainment worldwide, with a vast array of genres and titles available. This project utilizes data analysis techniques to understand trends, preferences, and correlations among anime viewers. Additionally, it provides a recommendation system to suggest anime titles to users based on their preferences.

## Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized text fields (e.g., converting text to lowercase)
- Encoded categorical variables

## Analysis

- EDA to understand the distribution of features, correlations, and trends.
- Visualization techniques such as histograms and scatter plots to illustrate patterns in the data.
- Statistical analysis to identify significant relationships or differences between variables.
- ### Word Cloud
Representing the most frequent words or terms in a dataset

## TF-IDF Vectorization

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization is a technique commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) to convert textual data into numerical vectors. It assigns weights to terms based on their frequency in a document and their rarity across all documents.

## Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity is a measure used to determine how similar two documents are based on their content. It calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors, representing the documents, in a multi-dimensional space.
